# Reaction Notes: Beta

Reaction Notes is a minimalist web application built with React for creating, editing, and managing notes with a clean, responsive interface. It supports Markdown formatting, note searching, and exporting notes as `.txt` or `.md` files. The app is designed for simplicity and ease of use, with a focus on providing a seamless note-taking experience across desktop and mobile devices.

  - Create notes with a title and content.
  - Edit notes in a sidebar (desktop) or full-screen (mobile) view.
  - Delete multiple notes using a selection mode.
- **Search Functionality**: Search notes by title or content with a toggleable content search option.
- **Markdown Support**: Enable Markdown to format notes with headings, bold, italics, lists, code, etc., with a live preview.
- **Export Notes**: Download individual notes as `.txt` or `.md` files.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, with a clean, dark-themed UI.
- **Local Storage**: Notes and user preferences (e.g., Markdown toggle) are persisted in the browser's local storage.
- **Branding**: Powered by TADSTech, with links to the projectâ€™s GitHub and TADSTech website in the footer.
